Sure, here are the answers to each question:

1. React is what defines JSX. We need to `import React from "react"` because React uses JSX (JavaScript XML), an extension of JavaScript that allows us to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. React components are written using JSX, and JSX gets transformed into JavaScript function calls by the React compiler. Therefore, we need to import React to use JSX in our files.

2. A JavaScript object. React elements that describe what React should
eventually add to the real DOM for us. If you were to `console.log(page)` in `index.js`, it would log the JSX code stored in the `page` variable. However, JSX code itself cannot be logged directly to the console. You would see something like `[object Object]` in the console, which represents the JavaScript object containing the JSX code.

3. We need our JSX to be nested under a single parent element. In the provided code, there's a syntax error because JSX elements must be wrapped in a single parent element. To fix it, you should wrap the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements in a single parent element, such as a `<div>`.

   ```jsx
   const page = (
       <div>
           <h1>Hello</h1>
           <p>This is my website!</p>
       </div>
   )
   ```

4. Declarative means I can tell the computer WHAT to do and expect it to handle the details. Imperative means I need to tell it HOW to do each step. In programming, being "declarative" means describing what you want to achieve without specifying how to achieve it step by step. React is declarative because you write components that describe how your UI should look based on the current state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that description.

5. We have small pieces that we can put together to make something larger/greater than the individual pieces. Being "composable" means that elements or components can be combined or nested together to create more complex structures. In React, components are composable, meaning you can create larger, more complex UI elements by combining smaller, simpler components. This makes it easier to manage and organize UI code, as well as reuse components across different parts of an application.
